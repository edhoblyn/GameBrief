## Ed — Web Scraping (Marvel Rivals)

**Branch:** `feature/scraper`

Patches are currently entered manually. This task builds a scraper to auto-import real patch notes from **Marvel Rivals** as a proof of concept. Their patch notes page is fully server-side rendered — no headless browser needed.

**Target site:** `https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/`

| # | Task | Done? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Add `source_url` string column to `patches` table: `rails g migration AddSourceUrlToPatches source_url:string` then `rails db:migrate` | ⬜ |
| 2 | Add `nokogiri` gem to the Gemfile (httparty is optional — `open-uri` works fine), then run `bundle install` | ⬜ |
| 3 | Add Marvel Rivals to the seed data (or `rails console`) so there's a `Game` record to attach patches to: `Game.create!(name: "Marvel Rivals", slug: "marvel-rivals", genre: "shooter")` | ⬜ |
| 4 | Create `app/services/scrapers/marvel_rivals_scraper.rb`. It should: fetch the index page (`https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/`), find all `a.list-item` elements, follow each link, then on the detail page extract `h1.artTitle` (title), `p.date` (date), and `div.artText` (full content). Return an array of `{ title:, content:, source_url: }` hashes. Set a browser-like `User-Agent` header to avoid being blocked. | ⬜ |
| 5 | Create a rake task `lib/tasks/patches.rake` with `rails patches:scrape_marvel_rivals`. It should call the scraper, then for each result call `Patch.find_or_initialize_by(source_url:)` and update `title` and `content` — this prevents duplicates on re-runs | ⬜ |
| 6 | Add a recurring job so Marvel Rivals patch scraping runs automatically every week in production | ⬜ |
| 7 | Test it locally: run `rails patches:scrape_marvel_rivals` and confirm patch records appear in the DB attached to the Marvel Rivals game | ⬜ |

**Follow-up for later:** add admin-only controls to trigger a manual scrape on demand and show the last successful scrape time/status.

**Key HTML selectors on the detail page:**

| What | Selector |
| --- | --- |
| All patch links (index) | `a.list-item` → `href` |
| Patch title (detail) | `h1.artTitle` |
| Date (detail) | `p.date` (format: `2026/03/04`) |
| Full content (detail) | `div.artText` |

## Hortense — Bug Fixes: Public Access + Styling

**Branch:** `bugfix/public-access-and-styling`

| # | Bug / Task | File(s) | Done? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Games index requires login** — `ApplicationController` has global `authenticate_user!`. `GamesController` needs `skip_before_action :authenticate_user!, only: [:index, :show]` so guests can browse games | `app/controllers/games_controller.rb` | ⬜ |
| 2 | **Devise mailer placeholder** — Change `config.mailer_sender` from `'please-change-me...'` to `'noreply@gamebrief.com'` | `config/initializers/devise.rb` | ⬜ |
| 3 | **Style Devise login and signup pages** — Add Bootstrap card wrapper and dark theme to match the rest of the app | `app/views/devise/sessions/new.html.erb`, `registrations/new.html.erb` | ⬜ |
| 4 | **Add `<meta>` description tag** to the application layout | `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` | ⬜ |
| 5 | **Check page titles** — Make sure every page sets a title using `content_for :title`. Add any that are missing | All views | ⬜ |

## Baptiste — Bug Fixes: Patches + Summaries

**Branch:** `bugfix/patches-and-summaries`

| # | Bug / Task | File(s) | Done? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **SQL injection risk** — `PatchesController#index` builds a raw SQL string using `followed_game_ids.join(',')`. Replace with a safe ActiveRecord query (e.g. `where(game_id: followed_game_ids)`) | `app/controllers/patches_controller.rb` | ⬜ |
| 2 | **SQL injection risk** — Same issue in `EventsController#index`. Apply the same fix | `app/controllers/events_controller.rb` | ⬜ |
| 3 | **Add loading state to Generate Summary button** — Disable the button on click with `data-disable-with="Generating..."` so it can't be double-submitted | Patch and event show views | ⬜ |
| 4 | **Wrap Claude API call in begin/rescue** — If `SummaryService` or `EventSummaryService` raises an error, catch it and redirect back with a flash error message instead of crashing | `app/services/summary_service.rb`, `app/services/event_summary_service.rb` | ⬜ |
| 5 | **Order patches by most recent first** on the game show page — change to `@game.patches.order(created_at: :desc)` | `app/controllers/games_controller.rb` or game show view | ⬜ |
| 6 | **Add flash message after generating a summary** — Show `"Summary generated!"` on success | `app/controllers/patches_controller.rb`, `app/controllers/events_controller.rb` | ⬜ |

## Bianca — Bug Fixes: Profile + Navbar

**Branch:** `bugfix/profile-and-navbar`

| # | Bug / Task | File(s) | Done? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Navbar avatar is hardcoded** — The navbar uses a placeholder image URL instead of `current_user.avatar_url`. Fix it to fall back to a generic avatar icon if `avatar_url` is blank | `app/views/shared/_navbar.html.erb` | ⬜ |
| 2 | **Profile page: show latest patch under each followed game** — On the My Profile page, under each game card show the title of the most recent patch (or "No patches yet" if none) | `app/views/pages/my_profile.html.erb` | ⬜ |
| 3 | **Profile page: show upcoming reminders** — On the My Profile page, list the user's upcoming event reminders (event name, date, link) | `app/views/pages/my_profile.html.erb` | ⬜ |
| 4 | **Add "Profile" link to navbar dropdown** — Link to `my_profile_path` in the user dropdown menu | `app/views/shared/_navbar.html.erb` | ⬜ |

## Demo Flow (End Goal)

The app should demonstrate this flow without errors:

1. Guest visits the home page and can browse games without logging in
2. User logs in with Google (or demo account: `demo@test.com` / `123456`)
3. Games index loads with cover images, search, genre filters, sort
4. User clicks a game and sees the game detail page
5. User clicks Follow on a game
6. User clicks a patch, sees the patch notes + 3 AI summary types, and can chat with the AI
7. User clicks an event, reads the AI summary, and sets a reminder
8. User visits My Profile and sees followed games, recent patches, and upcoming reminders
