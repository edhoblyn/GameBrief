| 3 | Add a filter bar to `events/index.html.erb` with three sets of filters (see below) | ⬜ |
| 4 | **Filter 1 — Event type:** "All" / "In-Game" / "IRL" — via `params[:event_type]` in `EventsController#index` | ⬜ |

| 6 | **Filter 3 — Time period:** "All" / "This Week" / "This Month" / "Future" — filter on `start_date` | ⬜ |

---

## Demo Flow (End Goal)

The app should demonstrate this flow without errors:

1. User visits the home page
2. User logs in with Google (or demo account)
3. Games index loads with cover images
4. User clicks a game and sees the game detail page with live streamers
5. User clicks Follow on the game
6. User clicks a patch, sees the patch notes + AI summary, and asks the chatbot a question
7. User clicks an event and sets a reminder
8. User visits My Profile and sees their followed games, patches, and upcoming events
